Project: Coin Segregation using DIP (Digital Image Processing)
Abstract:Indian currency coins come in a variety of denominations. Of all the varieties, Rs.1, Rs.2, and Rs.5 have similar diameters. The majority of the coin styles in market circulation for denominations of Rs.1 and Rs.2 coins are nearly the same except for numerals on their reverse side. If a coin is resting on its obverse side, the correct denomination is not distinguishable by humans. Therefore, it was hypothesized that a digital image of a coin resting on either side could be classified into its correct denomination by training a deep neural network model. The digital images were generated by using inexpensive cellphone cameras. To find the most suitable deep neural network architecture, four were selected based on preliminary analysis carried out for comparison. The results confirm that two of the four deep neural network models can classify the correct denomination from either side of a coin with an accuracy of 97%.
